# Financify-ML

## About The Model :
  - Developed with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, our model predicts inflation trends. Exported as .h5, it's deployed via Flask for user-friendly, real-time predictions.

## ML team responsibilities : 
  - Collect and prepare a dataset.
  - Building a machine learning model which can predict inflation
  - Testing the Model

## ML members :

# Folder Structure
## Final Model
Fixed files and models that can used to deploy

  - mainml.py = main file to make the model
  - mainml.ipynb = main file to make the model (jupyter notebook)
  - app.py = main file to deploy the model using Flask
  - all_cities_lstm_model_v3.h5 = main model to use for deploy

### Dataset
