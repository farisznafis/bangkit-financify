# Financify

## Description
Capstone Project from G30SCAM called Financify
Welcome to the Financify repository! This repository contains an efficient machine learning model that has been trained to perform the task of predicting inflation rate by their respective City in Indonesia.

The main goal of this project is to assist in the automated prediction of inflation into specific years or months. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to contribute to Education, Learning, and Personal Development efforts.

## Dataset

We used a custom inflation dataset for training the model. This dataset is available for download from the following link: [Custom Inflastion Dataset](https://github.com/farisznafis/bangkit-financify/tree/main/ML). The Dataset contains samples of different inflation rate in Indonesia for each month or years allowing our model to effectively predict inflation rates.


The Predicted inflation rate are categorized into:
1. By Month
2. By Year (2000-2022)

## Pre-Requisites

Before using this prediction model, please make sure you have the following prerequisites beforehand:

1. **Python**: You need to Python installed, preferably version 3.8 or later.

2. **Python Packages**: The necessary Python packages for running the model are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these packages using `pip` as shown below.
